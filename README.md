# vet-clinic-web-app
Web application that manages the interactions between clients and veterinarians. Clients can make appointments with certain doctors for their pet, which can be accepted or refused by the admin. If an appointment is accepted, it leads to an in-person consultation for the pet. Medical records are stored and bills created.
